## Lab 06 - Configuring passwordless sign-in using an authentication app (Read-Only)

### Estimated Duration: 15 Minutes

  >**Note**: During this Azure lab, you'll set up passwordless sign-in, which may involve registering personal mobile devices with Entra ID. We recommend following instructions provided and avoiding device registration unless necessary for learning objectives. Understand access implications within Azure.

**Pre-requisities** - Install the Microsoft Authenticator app in mobile

## Lab Overview 
This lab focuses on setting up passwordless sign-in using the Microsoft Authenticator app. They'll enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication methods, configure sign-in methods for users, and validate the passwordless sign-in process. 

## Lab Scenario
In this lab scenario, you are tasked with setting up  a corporate environment, employees are increasingly concerned about security and convenience in accessing company resources. To address this, the IT department has decided to implement passwordless sign-in using the Microsoft Authenticator app. Employees will be able to securely access company systems without the hassle of remembering complex passwords, enhancing both security and user experience.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will glance through the following:

  - Task 1: Enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication methods
  - Task 2: Configure signin methods to the user
  - Task 3: Enable Phone signin
  - Task 4: Validate the passwordless signin
  
### Task 1: Enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication methods

In this task, you configure passwordless authentication by enabling the Microsoft Authenticator app for all users in Microsoft Entra ID.

1. Sign in to https://entra.microsoft.com/.

1. On the **Pick an account** page, select **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**.

1. On the **Enter password** page, enter the password **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>**.

1. From the left navigation pane, browse to Protection > Authentication methods > Policies.

1. Select **Microsoft Authenticator**

1. Under **Microsoft Authenticator settings**, choose the following options within the Enable and Target tab.

      - Enable - yes (1)
      - Target - All users (2)
      - Authentication mode - select **Any** (3)

1. Click on **Save** (4) to enable passwordless sign for All users.

### Task 2: Configure signin methods to the user

In this task, you configure sign-in methods for a user by adding the Microsoft Authenticator app as a sign-in method. This involves linking the app to the user's account by scanning a QR code and verifying the setup. 

1. Navigate to https://portal.office.com using the credentials provided in the environment details page.

1. Select the profile icon located at the top right corner and select **View account**.

1. Select the **Security info** > **+Add signin method**

   >**Note:** If you are prompted to sign in using the SMS code click on **Text** and enter the code and sign in.

1. Under **Add a Method**, choose **Authenticator app** and click **Add**.

1. Select **Next** twice until the QR code page is visible.

1. Open Microsoft Authenticator which was installed in your mobile, click on **Add account** > **Work or school account**.

1. On **Add work or school account**, select **Scan a QR code** to scan the QR code from the browser to add the account.

1. Once the account is added, on the browser page showing QR Code, click **Next** to approve this request using Authenticator app and to add this method in signin page.

### Task 3: Enable Phone signin

In this task, you enable phone sign-in for a user by configuring the Microsoft Authenticator app to allow authentication via the app instead of a password.

1. Open **Authenticator app** and select the account added and click on **set up phone signin** and click **Continue**.

1. Enter the password provided in the environment details page and approve the sign-in requests.

1. Select **Register** to register the device.

1. Click on **Finish** after the setup completion.

   >**Note**: Please wait for about 5 mins and proceed with next task.

### Task 4: Validate the passwordless signin

In this task, you validate the passwordless sign-in by logging into the Azure portal using the phone sign-in method. Instead of entering a password, you approve the sign-in request through the Microsoft Authenticator app.

1. Open the incognito tab, and navigate to https://portal.azure.com/

1. On the **Sign in** page, enter the email address of the same user who had registered with phone signin.

1. On the **Enter Password** page, select the **Use an app instead** and it will provide a two digit number and ask to enter in authenticator app pop-up in the mobile to approve the sign in request.

1. Once it is approved in the app, it will redirect to the home page of the azure portal without prompting for password.

## Review
In this lab, you have completed:

- Enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication methods
- Configure signin methods to the user
- Enable Phone signin
- Validate the passwordless signin

## Conclusion

Throughout this comprehensive Hybrid Identity lab series, you have successfully implemented a complete enterprise-scale identity management solution that seamlessly integrates on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID. Starting with foundational hybrid identity setup and AD synchronization, you progressed through enabling self-service password reset with password writeback, implementing privileged access management with time-bound role assignments, establishing comprehensive monitoring and audit capabilities through Log Analytics, configuring adaptive security controls with conditional access and multi-factor authentication, managing access governance through recurring access reviews, and finally implementing modern passwordless authentication methods. This lab series has equipped you with the essential skills to architect, deploy, and manage a robust hybrid identity infrastructure that enhances security posture, ensures regulatory compliance, improves user experience, and scales effectively across enterprise environments. By combining on-premises governance with cloud-based identity services, conditional access policies, privileged identity management, comprehensive monitoring, and modern authentication methods, you have created a secure, compliant, and user-friendly identity solution capable of protecting organizational resources while enabling seamless access for legitimate users across both on-premises and cloud platforms.
