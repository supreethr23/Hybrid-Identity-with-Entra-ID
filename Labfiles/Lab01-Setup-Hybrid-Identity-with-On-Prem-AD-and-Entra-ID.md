# Lab 1: Setup Hybrid Identity with On-Prem AD and Entra ID

## Lab Overview 
This lab focuses on setting up a hybrid identity solution using on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra ID. It guides users through the process of configuring Active Directory on a Windows Server, adding users/groups to the domain controller, and configuring directory synchronization with Microsoft Entra Connect to sync identities between on-premises AD and Entra ID.

## Lab Scenario
In this lab scenario, you are tasked with setting up a hybrid identity solution to seamlessly manage user identities across on-premises and cloud environments. By configuring Active Directory on a Windows Server, adding users/groups, and setting up directory synchronization with Microsoft Entra Connect, organizations can achieve centralized identity management and enable single sign-on capabilities for their users.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1: Active Directory Setup
- Task 2: Adding users or groups in your Domain Controller
- Task 3: Configure directory synchronization with Entra ID Connect
- Task 4: Verify synchronization in Entra ID

## Estimated timing: 90 minutes

## Task 1: Active Directory Setup
In this task, you will set up Active Directory Domain Services on a Windows Server. This involves launching Server Manager, adding roles and features, selecting Active Directory Domain Services, and promoting the server to a domain controller. By completing this task, you will establish the foundation for managing users, groups, and other objects within your domain.

1. Once the VM is launched, press the Windows Logo Key and search for **Server Manager**. An application should show up on the list. Click on it to launch the program.

1. On the left side of the window, you’ll see a list of all the checkpoints you encounter in this stage. Click **Next**.

    ![](../media/lab1-3.png)  
 
1. At the **Installation Type** checkpoint select **Role-based or feature based installation** radio button and then click **Next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-4.png)
   
1. On the **Server Selection** checkpoint, select Select a **server from the server pool** radio button. This lists a server installed on your machine. Please, click on the desired server once to select it and click **Next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-5.png)
   
1. At the **Select Server Roles** checkpoint, select the role for the server. In the centre of the window, there is a list of all the roles that you can assign to your server machine. Search for **Active Directory Domain Services**.

   ![](../media/lab1-6.png)
   
1. Next, a pop-up window will be displayed. This is the checkpoint for adding new features. Navigate on the **Add features** button at the bottom of the window and a list of available features will be displayed.
   
1. Next simply click **next** without making modifications to any other settings.

   ![](../media/lab1-7.png) 
  
1. You will be redirected to the adding **Active Directory Domain Services** feature once the previous step is complete. On the installer wizard window, click **Next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-8.png)
    
1. You’ll see a summary of your selected options here. Have a look at them carefully, and if you think you’ve made a mistake at any of the earlier checkpoints, you can go back and fix it by clicking “previous.” Then, click **Install** button, once you’re satisfied with your selections at the “Confirmation” checkpoint.

   ![](../media/lab1-9.png) 
  
1. The wizard will then begin installation. The time of install depends on your machine’s hardware configuration and what features you’ve selected to be installed. Please make sure not to interrupt the installation. Once the installation is complete, click the **Close** button.

  
1. Relaunch **Server Manager** if you have already closed it. On your Server Manager dashboard, you’ll should see a yellow triangle warning sign on the top right of the window near the menu bar. This sign appears only if Active Directory Domain Services was properly installed.

   ![](../media/lab1-10.png)    
1. Click on the warning sign and a dropdown list will show you the required actions termed **post-deployment configuration**.
   
1. Look for the **Promote this server to a domain controller** option and click on it.

   ![](../media/lab1-11.png)
 
1. At the first checkpoint “Deployment Configuration”, please select the **add a new forest** radio button and enter your root domain name as **Contoso.local**. Then click **next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-12.png) 

1. At the “Domain Controller Options” checkpoint, leave all the settings untouched and enter your password and confirm it. Make sure to keep a note of this password as changing it later on is troublesome.

   ![](../media/lab1-13.png)
 
1. On the DNS Options page, you’l see an error message stating that there’s no parent zone found and no delegation for your DNS server could be created. Ignore this message and click the **next** button, leaving all the settings at this checkpoint unchanged.

   ![](../media/lab1-14.png)

1. On the Additional Options page, enter your desired NetBIOS domain name in the given textbox. Click **Next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-15.png)

1. Three or more paths will be listed on your screen. Do not change these paths. You’re not required to keep a note of these paths either. Click **next**.

   ![](../media/lab1-16.png)

1. Whatever options you’ve selected so far will listed on the configuration wizard at this checkpoint. Have a look at them and if needed, move to the previous checkpoints using the “previous” button and make the desired changes. Once you’re satisfied with the selected options, click **next** on the “Review Options”.

   ![](../media/lab1-17.png)

1. Next, head to the “Prerequisites Check” checkpoint. At this stage you’ll see, if all the prerequisite checks were successfully completed. If not, then a list of errors will be displayed on the window. If there are any errors, you’ll need to go to the stated checkpoint and fix the errors. Once you’ve fixed all the errors, a green check mark with a success message will be displayed. Then click **Install** to begin the installation.

   ![](../media/lab1-18.png)

1. Congratulations! You have successfully set up Active Directory on your Windows Server. Next, your server machine will restart once the promotion is successfully completed. You will lose the access to the LabVM for a while until restarts completes.

## Task 2: Adding users or groups in your Domain Controller
In this task, you will add user accounts to the domain controller in Active Directory Users and Computers. You will create new user accounts with specified names, usernames, and passwords. By adding users to the domain controller, you will ensure that they have access to resources within the domain and can authenticate against Active Directory.

1. Go to Start > Windows Administrative Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers.

   ![](../media/lab1-19.png)

1. In a new Desktone hosted Domain controller, Expand the folder which represents the domain and expand the **Users** folder.

   ![](../media/lab1-20.png)

1. To create a new user, Click **user icon** and create the users with the following info.

      | Name           | User Name                | Password   | 
      | -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
      | Edmund Reeve   | `ereeve@Contoso.local`   | Pa55-w.rd! |
      | Miranda Snider | `msnider@Contoso.local`  | Pa55-w.rd! | 
      | Allan Deyoung  | `AllanD@Contoso.local`   | Pa55-w.rd! | 
      | Joni Sherman   | `JoniS@Contoso.local`    | Pa55-w.rd! | 

1. Please find the below images indicating the user creation process. Repeat these steps to create all users.
