# Getting Started with Hybrid Identity with Entra ID

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore the complete Hybrid Identity experience with Entra ID. You'll work through hands-on exercises designed to strengthen your organization's security posture by configuring passwordless authentication, access reviews, external collaboration, conditional access policies, monitoring, auditing, and Privileged Identity Management (PIM). You will also learn how to enable self-service password reset (SSPR) and seamlessly integrate on-premises Active Directory with Entra ID to implement a robust hybrid identity solution. Through guided steps and practical scenarios, this lab will equip you with the skills needed to secure and manage identities across both on-premises and cloud environments.

## Objectives

By completing this lab series, you will have comprehensive knowledge of designing, deploying, and managing a Hybrid Identity solution with Microsoft Entra ID for enterprise-scale adoption:

- Configure Active Directory Domain Services and synchronize on-premises AD identities with Microsoft Entra ID using Entra Connect.
- Enable self-service password reset with password writeback and validate synchronization across on-premises and cloud environments.
- Assign Azure resource roles with Privileged Identity Management using time-bound, eligible assignments with approval workflows.
- Create a Log Analytics Workspace and configure diagnostic settings to collect and analyze Entra ID audit and sign-in logs.
- Create security groups, configure recurring access reviews, and set up external collaboration with guest user access controls.
- Enable passwordless phone sign-in using Microsoft Authenticator app and validate authentication without passwords.

## Architecture

- **Hybrid Identity Framework** integrates on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID to enable enterprise-scale identity management and governance. **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** serves as the on-premises identity foundation, managing users, groups, and resources within the corporate network. **Microsoft Entra Connect** facilitates seamless directory synchronization between on-premises AD and Microsoft Entra ID, enabling unified identity management across cloud and on-premises environments.

- **Microsoft Entra ID** provides centralized cloud-based identity and access management, enforcing **security baselines, conditional access policies** to protect resources. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** manages and monitors privileged access through time-bound, approval-based role assignments, ensuring security and governance controls. **Log Analytics Workspace** and **Azure Monitor** collect and analyze audit logs, sign-in logs, and security events for compliance, threat detection, and operational insights.

- **Access Reviews** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** establish governance controls, enabling regular access validation and least-privilege permissions. **External Collaboration Settings** and **Guest User Management** facilitate secure partner and vendor access with configurable invitation and access restrictions. **Passwordless Authentication** (Microsoft Authenticator app and phone sign-in) enhances security while improving user experience. **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** with password writeback ensures users can manage credentials securely while maintaining synchronization between cloud and on-premises environments.

## Explanation of Components

- **Microsoft Entra ID:** Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and conditional access capabilities. It serves as the central identity provider for cloud and hybrid environments, enabling organizations to authenticate users, manage application access, and enforce security policies across the organization.

- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):** Active Directory Domain Services is the on-premises identity management system that manages users, computers, and resources within a corporate network. It provides authentication, authorization, and directory services, forming the foundation of on-premises identity infrastructure and requiring synchronization with cloud services through tools like Microsoft Entra Connect.

- **Microsoft Entra Connect:** Microsoft Entra Connect is a synchronization tool that bridges on-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling bidirectional identity synchronization. It ensures that user accounts, groups, and contacts are consistently maintained across both environments, while supporting password writeback for on-premises password changes initiated from the cloud.

- **Azure Monitor:** Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring service that collects, analyzes, and visualizes telemetry data from Azure resources, applications, and on-premises systems. It enables proactive performance tracking, anomaly detection, and issue identification through metrics, logs, and traces, providing insights into system health, availability, and performance trends.

- **Azure Log Analytics:** Azure Log Analytics is a powerful tool within Azure Monitor that collects and queries logs from various Azure services, on-premises resources, and third-party sources. It provides deep insights into application health, performance, security events, and user behavior through Kusto Query Language (KQL), enabling investigation, alerting, and compliance reporting for security and operational purposes.
